## The story
In this game you play as a kid who plays with their broken toys after their parents divorced, the reason these toys are broken is because during the messy divorce
one of the parents took their sibling with them, in the ensuing fight over the toys the toys fell and broke. Now with only spare parts the kid tries to make
the best of it.

the puzzles solvable.
